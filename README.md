Zenlabs Agent Tracker App
==========

No real app interface to speak of but this app just adds the Agent Name and/or the agent group to the ticket when the agent views the ticket. If the ticket is updated then the changes stick. If the agent doesn't update the ticket then no changes are made. Very simple port of a Classic widget.
